        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Butternut squash is high in antioxidants, fiber, and vitamins, making it one of the healthiest foods for your infant. Roasting squash in the oven is straightforward; once soft, the orange flesh may be easily scraped from the rough skins. You may use this procedure to substitute any other winter squash.</p>
        <p>This recipe is suitable for babies aged 6 months and up.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out and remove the seeds and fibers with a metal spoon. Put the squash in a baking dish large enough to contain both halves, cut-side down. Fill the pan with 12 cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) water. <img src="./images/butternut-squash-puree/erik-mclean-aPoF91L-n6k-unsplash.jpg" alt="Oven Photo by Erik Mclean via https://www.unsplash.com"></li>

            <li>Scoop out the meat with a metal spoon, discarding the skins. Put the squash to a blender, mixer, or food processor and puree until extremely smooth or chunky, depending on the age and chewing skills of your baby. If necessary, thin the puree with water, breast milk, or formula. <img src="./images/butternut-squash-puree/rumman-amin-eIqO4P50MeY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Mixer Photo by Rumman Amin via https://www.unsplash.com"></li>
            <li><em>Storage Tip:</em> Refrigerate the puree for up to three days in an airtight container, or freeze for up to three months. Spoon into ice cube trays for single servings that melt quickly. <img src="./images/butternut-squash-puree/karyna-panchenko-2beCqCd8mAc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Puree Photo by Karyna Panchenko via https://www.unsplash.com"></li>
